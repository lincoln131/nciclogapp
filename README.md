# nciclogapp
I made this so that our Communications Center can easily log what is added to NCIC or removed from NCIC.
I've been using this as a learning tool, and this project has been my first serious attempt at a rails app. 

I've set the fields on add or edit to read only if there is previous data in them. They shouldn't be able to edit for this use case.

I've set most fields to required on add or edit, so they can't leave out important info.
